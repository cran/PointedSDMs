\title{Dataset of Eucalyptus globulus (common name: blue gum) sightings collected across the Koala conservation reserve on Phillip island (Australia) between 1993 and 2004. Two marks are considered from this dataset: "koala" which describes the number of koala visits to each tree, and "food" which is some index of the palatability of the leaves.}
\format{
\code{eucTrees} is a \code{data.frame} object (1284 observations; 6 variables) with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{E}{Latitude of the observation.}
\item{N}{Longitude of the observation.}
\item{FOOD}{Some value of the palatability of the leaves of the trees.}
\item{koala}{The number of koala sightings per tree.}
\item{nitrogen}{Total nitrogen (mg.g-1 DM).}
\item{dbh}{Diameter at breast hight of the trees (cm).}
