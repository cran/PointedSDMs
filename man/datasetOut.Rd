\title{\emph{datasetOut}: function that removes a dataset out of the main model, and calculates some cross-validation score.}
\usage{
datasetOut(model, dataset, predictions = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model of class bru_sdm run with multiple datasets.}

\item{dataset}{Names of the datasets to leave out. If missing, will run for all datasets used in the full model.}

\item{predictions}{Will new models be used for predictions. If \code{TRUE} returns marginals and bru_info in model. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list of inlabru models with the specified dataset left out. If predictions is \code{FALSE}, these objects will be missing their \code{bru_info} and \code{call} lists.
}
\description{
This function calculates the difference in covariate values between a full integrated model and a model with one dataset left out, as well as some cross-validation score, which is used to obtain a score of the relative importance of the dataset in the full model. The score is calculated as follows:
\enumerate{

  \item Running a new model with one less dataset (from the main model) -- resulting in a reduced model,
  \item predicting the intensity function at the locations of the left-out dataset with the reduced model,
  \item using the predicted values as an offset in a new model,
  \item finding the difference between the marginal-likelihood of the main model (ie the model with all the datasets considered) and the marginal-likelihood of the offset model.
